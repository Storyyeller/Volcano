# Volcano
A GUI for Krakatau assembler / disassembler built with Electron and CodeMirror.

Download from https://github.com/redking00/Volcano/releases

Krakatau (https://github.com/Storyyeller/Krakatau) is included as a pyInstaller executable. Only win32-x64 support for now.
 
You can edit and assemble *.j source files and disassemble class or jar files.
 
The syntax highlighting is 95% completed. There is work to do yet.

Let me know if you find any errors, have a comment or found it useful. ;)


**TODO

    - 100% Syntax support.
    - Verification of numerical literals.
    - Code snipets templates.
    - ...
